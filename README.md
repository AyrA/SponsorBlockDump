# SponsorBlock Dump

Utility that downloads the SponsorBlock CSV dumps and creates an SQLite database from it

## Usage

Simply run `createdb.ps1` in PowerShell.
Use `Get-Help .\createdb.ps1 -Detailed` for more information.

Once completed you find the database in the DB folder.

## About SQLite and consistency

To speed up the process of creating the database,
various settings are changed during database creation.
These settings can result in a corrupted database in case of a crash,
or if the user aborts the process.

This is generally not a problem, because all data is merely imported, and not generated by other means.
Should your database go corrupt, you can simply re-run the script,
optionally using the `-NoDownload` argument to skip the CSV download if you believe it to be complete.
